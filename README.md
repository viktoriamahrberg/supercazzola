# About

**Supercazzola** which in italian means *nonsense*; "a phrase devoid of logical sense composed of a random set of real and non-existent words". Let's skip the pretentious talk about wine and just focus on really good wine!
For us is it just about good, non pretentious natural wines from our firends in Italy and South Africa. They may be the avkommorna från stora klassiska vingårdar som nu experimenterar på egen hand, eller nya vingårdar som bara kör sin grej - så länge vi tycker det är gott are we proud to be your local wine provider in Southern Sweden. Beacuse we assure you - you *will* come back for more. 

Natural wine, or low intervention wine as it's also called, are often described as "nothing added, nothing taken away. 
Wine as it´s purest. 


## Business Goal

# Features

## UX Design

Use a clean layout and a proven e-commerce structure for a smooth navigation on the site. 
Research amongst competitors show quite pale choice of colors and the few that caught my eye had a stronger visual approach and therefor decided to go with a strong shade of yellow (quite a characteristic color of natural wine capsules, which you sometime see made of rubber), also the color of the sun and without sun no wine. Black and white for simplicity and generated complimentary colors through [Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) to set the contrasting colors for strong visual identity.
This also supports by our target audience being interested in art and design, looking for that different wine to stand out amongst their friends. 
The age of target audience is proven to spend most of their time on the phone - therefor a fully responsive website on smaller devices is crucial. 

### Font

I wanted to create an artsy look of the logo and first went for a grafitti style font. When doing research of font pairings I found the Google Font "Permanent Marker" matched with "Overpass Regular" on [Heyreliable.com](https://heyreliable.com/) and knew immediately that I wanted these two - one for an artsy "not giving a f"-look and one for a clean and neat read.
