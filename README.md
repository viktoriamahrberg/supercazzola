# About

**Supercazzola** which in italian means nonsense; "a phrase devoid of logical sense composed of a random set of real and non-existent words". Let's skip the pretentious talk about wine and just focus on really good wine!
For us it is just about good, non pretentious low intervention wines from our friends in Italy and South Africa. 
They may be the sons and daughters from the more classic wineries or new vinyard experimenting and just doing their own thing. Either way, they are making their own paths and pushing wine making into the future, experimenting on their own and providing us with outstanding wines. As long as we find it great, we are proud to be your local wine distributor in Southern Sweden. 
Because we assure you - you will come back for more. 


## Business Goal

Become the biggest importer of natural wine in Sweden. Targeting the people loving wine but may not necessarily know so much about it. 

## Tone of Voice

We'll share informational and "educational" content in a witty, non pretentious way - not taking for granted that our community know it all.  

## Business Model

B2C (Buiness to Customer) - A carefully selected e-commerce of imported natural wines to sell to winelovers over 21 years old in Sweden. Selection will mainly come from South Africa and Italy, seeing the gap in the market of South African low intervention wines, will especially make Supercazzola a name for itself. 
B2B (Business to business) - A big part of Supercazzolas business model will be to distribute wine to bars and restaurants in the southern part of Sweden. Wine events, wine tastings and pop-up events will have our presence. 

Since we offer alcoholic beverage we will not have sales nor discounts on our products, but will rather make sure our community have fun at our accessable events and wine tastings, which will be shared by newsletter to those who sign up.


## Target Audience

- Age: 21-55
- Informed as well as non-informed winelovers
- Most likely to live in or close to cities 
- Interests: Music, design/art, going out-ers (bars/restaurants), books and independent magazines
- Persona: Curious, traveller, informed, openminded, likes spending money on the good stuff in life

## Marketing 

Our community will be reached through Newsletters in which users can sign up to from the footer of the site with Mailchimp. Mailchimp will store the email addresses and with time we will organise the users into groups depending on what they want from us: Will it be updates regarding new wines coming in, or eventseekers or those that are most interested in reading about wine an a witty informative way. We will shape email groups after their preference.
 
Our target audience is mostily on Instagram and that is where we will meet them - adding posts and resharing posts from our community (if they fit our brand image) on a close to daily basis in order to rank high in our followers post stream.

#Â Features

## UX Design

Use a clean layout and a proven e-commerce structure for a smooth navigation on the site. 
Research amongst competitors show quite pale choice of colors and the few that caught my eye had a stronger visual approach and therefor decided to go with a strong shade of yellow (quite a characteristic color of natural wine capsules, which you sometime see made of rubber), also the color of the sun and without sun no wine. Black and white for simplicity and generated complimentary colors through [Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) to set the contrasting colors for strong visual identity.
This also supports by our target audience being interested in art and design, looking for that different wine to stand out amongst their friends. 
The age of target audience is proven to spend most of their time on the phone - therefor a fully responsive website on smaller devices is crucial. 

### Font

I wanted to create an artsy look of the logo and first went for a grafitti style font. When doing research of font pairings I found the Google Font "Permanent Marker" matched with "Overpass Regular" on [Heyreliable.com](https://heyreliable.com/) and knew immediately that I wanted these two - one for an artsy "not giving a f"-look that suits the brand image and tone of voice, and one for a clean and neat read.

## Wireframes
The wiresframes differs slightly from the end result, but the main idea is still very much there. A consistent page layout on most pages for a no-surprising user experience with the focus on straight-to-the-point and product sales. 
Some content is hidden on smaller devices to ensure the mobilescreen gives the user the most important and relevant information.

## Planning / Agile Management
I used the Github kanban board to create issues and user stories in the early development stages of this project and moved them across the board as I progressed from ToDo -> In Progress -> Done. Link to [Github Project](https://github.com/viktoriamahrberg/supercazzola/projects/1)
Userstories were organised in "must-have", "could-have" or "should-have" labels in order to make prioritization of the scope easier. 
I added userstories as I went on and realised what I want to add to the site in the future and have kept them in Backlog for further assessment after this project has been handed in.

I set up the project into 3 sprints:

*Sprint 1* (23-25th May):
- Researching competitors
- Planning
- User Stories 
- UX / designing the site
- Set up wireframes
- Database schema

*Sprint 2* (25 May - 8th June):
- Building the site

*Sprint 3* (8 May - 13th June):
- Readme.md
- Tweaks
- Testing
- Responsiveness

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
